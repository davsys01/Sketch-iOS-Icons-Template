Sketch-iOS-Icons-Template
=========================

A .sketch file with ALL the iOS app icon sizes, for iOS apps, App store and Web apps.

There are the following pages:

## App Icons
These are specific app icons for the app store.

## Launch Icons
These are specific to the actuall app itself, and are the "loading" images.

## Touch Icons
These are for safari web apps. These are the icons that will appears at the bookmark, and on the users homescreen.

## Startup Icons
These are similar to the launch icons, only that these are labelled differently and are specifically for web apps.

## Favicon
And finally we have a favicon, because you shouldn't over look this little guy.

### Labelling
The artboards whithin each page have been labelled such that you can export all - and they will labelled as per Apple's guidelines.
I have included separate '@x2's for retina screens. If you wanted to you can just either draw your icons and let Sketch do the normal (@x1) version. But you will then need to rename the newly created file.
Or you could do your artwork on the regular sizes and then use Sketch's @x2 feature? S'up to you. I like control.

If you spot any bug, errors with any of htese - file an Issue and i'll sort them out.
